# To-Do App

A simple and interactive to-do list web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks. It's a fun way to keep track of things you need to do!

## Features

- **Add New Task**: Easily add tasks using an input field and a button.
- **Complete Tasks**: Click on tasks to mark them as completed (strike-through).
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks when they are no longer needed.
- **Clean and Simple Design**: Built with modern, responsive UI elements for easy use.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Markup language for structuring the content.
- **CSS**: Styling for a clean, minimalistic design.
- **JavaScript**: Adds functionality for task management (add, remove, toggle completion).
